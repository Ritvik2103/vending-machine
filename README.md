# Vending Machine
This project implements a digital vending machine using **Verilog HDL**. The design includes multiple functional modules for managing item selection, payment processing, and item dispensing. 

---

## Features
- **Multi-Module Design**: Modular architecture for scalability and clarity.
- **Item Selection**: Supports multiple item categories.
- **Payment Processing**: Simulates coin and note acceptance.
- **Item Dispensing**: Ensures accurate delivery of selected items.
- **Error Handling**: Handles insufficient payment and out-of-stock scenarios.

## Project Workflow
1. **RTL Design**:
   - Developed using **Verilog** with a hierarchical approach.
   - Modularized design for easy extensibility.

2. **Functional Verification**:
   - Created a comprehensive **testbench** to verify the design functionality.
   - Simulated using **Vivado** to ensure correctness under different scenarios.

3. **Synthesis**:
   - Synthesized the design using **Vivado**, generating a netlist for implementation.
   - Verified synthesis results for timing and resource utilization.

4. **Timing Analysis**:
   - Conducted pre-layout **static timing analysis (STA)** to ensure timing closure.
   - Focused on setup and hold checks for design reliability.
